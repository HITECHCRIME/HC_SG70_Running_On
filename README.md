## Music Video

I surrender to the witches and let my companion go.
Ritual in the forest. Women in pastel colors and clothing surrounding me.
The perform an immolation. They set me on fire I sign as I burn to charcoal and still move my lips (ending of the song).
In the meantime I shatter through many mirrors of myself only to reach the end.
